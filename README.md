# ES-DE Frontend

ES-DE (EmulationStation Desktop Edition) is a frontend for browsing and launching games from your multi-platform collection.

ES-DE-Plus is a fork of ES-DE whose own source remains MIT-licensed. As upstream does, its Android builds link the GPL-2.0-only PDF converter and Poppler in process, so distributed ES-DE-Plus Android APKs are GPL-2.0 combined works whose complete corresponding source is public in this repository. See [the Android dependency inventory](android/DEPENDENCY-LICENSES.md) for component licences.

It's officially supported on Android, Linux, macOS, Windows and Haiku. There is also an unofficial ES-DE package in the FreeBSD ports collection.

The goal of this project is to create a high quality frontend that is easy to use, requires minimal setup and configuration, looks nice, and is available across a wide range of operating systems.

It comes preconfigured for use with a large selection of emulators, game engines, game managers and gaming services and it can also run locally installed games and applications. It's fully customizable, so you can easily expand it with support for additional systems and applications.

You can find the complete list of supported game systems in the [User guide](USERGUIDE.md#supported-game-systems) and in the [Android](ANDROID.md#supported-game-systems), [Linux on AArch64](LINUX-AARCH64.md#supported-game-systems) and [Haiku](HAIKU.md#supported-game-systems) documentation.

There are many high-quality themes that can be installed using the built-in theme downloader. You can also find the web version of the themes list here: \

_The **System view**, which is the default starting point for the application, it's here that you browse through your game systems._

![alt text](images/es-de_gamelist_view.png "ES-DE Gamelist View")
_The **Gamelist view**, it's here that you browse the actual games per system._

![alt text](images/es-de_folder_support.png "ES-DE Folder Support")
_Another example of the gamelist view, displaying advanced folder support. You can scrape folders for game info and game media, sort folders as you would files, mark them as favorites etc._

![alt text](images/es-de_custom_collections.png "ES-DE Custom Collections")
_Games can be grouped into your own custom collections, in this example they're defined as genres._

![alt text](images/es-de_scraper_running.png "ES-DE Scraper Running")
_This is a view of the built-in scraper which downloads game info and game media from either [screenscraper.fr](https://screenscraper.fr) or [thegamesdb.net](https://thegamesdb.net). It's possible to scrape a single game, or to run the multi-scraper which can scrape a complete game system or even your entire collection._

![alt text](images/es-de_scraper_settings.png "ES-DE Scraper Settings")
_There are many settings for the scraper including options to define which type of info and media to download. The above screenshot shows only a portion of these settings._

![alt text](images/es-de_metadata_editor.png "ES-DE Metadata Editor")
_In addition to the scraper there is a fully-featured metadata editor that can be used to modify information on a per-game basis._

![alt text](images/es-de_screensaver.png "ES-DE Screensaver")
_There are four built-in screensavers, including a slideshow and a video screensaver that display random games from your collection._

![alt text](images/es-de_ui_theme_support.png "ES-DE Theme Support")
_ES-DE is fully themeable, in case you prefer another look than what the default theme Linear offers. The screenshot above shows the Slate theme that is bundled with the application for the desktop ports._
